## ‚úîÔ∏è How to Start
### 1) Prerequisites
* Java 11
* IntelliJ IDEA or eclipse
* MySQL Workbrench
* Redis

### 2) Clone
Clone this repo to your local machine using:  
```
git clone https://github.com/Beach-Combine/Backend.git
```
### 3) Setup
- Add `env.properties` in `resources`
  - Fill in the blank space after the equal sign with your own words
```
application.spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/beachcombine?serverTimezone=Asia/Seoul
application.spring.datasource.username=root
application.spring.datasource.password=
application.jwt.secret=
application.jwt.secret_refresh=
application.spring.cloud.gcp.storage.credentials.location=classpath:beach-combine-3770712535c0.json
application.spring.cloud.gcp.storage.project-id=
application.spring.cloud.gcp.storage.bucket=
application.spring.cloud.gcp.geocodingAPI=
application.spring.datasource.databaseAPI=
```
- Add `beach-combine-3770712535c0.json` in `resources`
  - Private key issued by GCP (If you don't want to use image-related APIs, it's okay to just create a file and leave the file content empty)
- Creating a database called `beachcombine` in MySQL workbrench
- `compileQuerydsl`
- Change the value of the `ddl-auto` variable inside `application.yml` from `none` to `create` only on the first execution.
- Run `BackendApplication`

## üì≤ Easy Start

### For Android User 

1. Download apk file ‚≠ê [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o0lQqgl7VHFFrbijnl_atLjot7o1Y9GQ/view?usp=sharing) ‚≠ê. (Available for Android version 12 or higher)
2. You can use it right away by installing it on your smartphone!
- Currently, this service is providing beta service for Busan, Korea

### Tip
Our service is currently focused on Busan, South Korea. Therefore, we provide a testing feature for customers in inland areas or those who cannot visit Busan to experience the entire cleaning process.

Upon entering the home screen, users will see a `Test` button. When they press this button, their current location will be moved to the Busan area, allowing them to explore various features. If users move to a different location from their current position, the screen will reflect the corresponding change. Feel free to click on nearby markers to experience different feedback.

Please note that this feature is designed solely for testing purposes and is not reflected in the actual database. Therefore, no rewards will be given upon completing the entire cleaning process. Keep this in mind!

In the actual Busan sea, all features can be used without any issues. Come and enjoy Busan!

## ‚úÖ Server Deployment Process (CI/CD using Github Actions)

### Local : Gradle build, Docker build
1. jar build : `gradle build`
2. image creation : `docker build -t yourAccountName/repositoryName ./`
3. push to Docker Hub : `docker push yourAccountName/repositoryName`

(`AccoutName` and `RepositoryName` are from Docker Hub)

### Server : Deploy
1. Pull from Docker Hub : `docker pull yourAccountName/repositoryName`
2. Create image as configured in Docker-compose.yml : `docker tag yourAccountName/repositoryName dockerImageName`
3. Run Docker Compose : `docker-compose up`

(`dockerImageName` should be written as the image name in Docker-compose.yml)

## ‚ùó GIT Strategy

### 1) Git Workflow

### main ‚Üí develop ‚Üí feature/Issue#-feature, fix/Issue#-feature, refactor/Issue#-feature

1. Work individually on each branch `local - feature/Issue#-feature`
2. After completing the task, submit a PR to `remote - develop`.
3. After code review, receive approval and merge
4. Every time a merge occurs in `remote - develop`, all team members pull from `remote - develop` to maintain the latest status

### 2) Commit Convention

| Tag name | Description                                                 |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| feat     | Commits that add a new feature                              |
| fix      | Commits that fix a bug                                      |
| hotfix   | Fix an urgent bug in issue or QA                            |
| build    | Commits that affect build components                        |
| chore    | Miscellaneous commits                                       |
| style    | Commits for code styling or format                          |
| docs     | Commits that affect documentation only                      |
| test     | Commits that add missing tests or correcting existing tests |
| refactor | Commits for code refactoring                                |

## üìë Coding Convention

### 1) Naming Convention

- Variables, functions, and class names should use camelCase.
- For functions, use a verb followed by a noun.
  e.g.) getInfo()
- Column names stored in the DB should use snake_case.
  e.g.) member_id
- URL names should use kebab-case, consisting of lowercase nouns.
- Use hyphens (-) as separators, and avoid using separators when possible.
  e.g.) **[www.example.com/user](http://www.example.com/user)**

### 2) Builder

- To improve readability, builders are required instead of constructors
